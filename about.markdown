STAT340 serves as an introduction to many of the principles and practices of data science.
Ultimately, the goal of data science is to explain and predict real-world phenomena based on our observations (i.e., data), using statistical and mathematical models of those phenomena.
This course will introduce students to the process of collecting, cleaning, modeling and analyzing data to answer questions about the world.
